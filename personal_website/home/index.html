                    <span>W</span>elcome to my page! My name is Zhixin Xu. I joined Northeastern University in 2023 after completing my bachelor's 
                    degree in financial management. Although I didn't have much prior experience in technology, 
                    I gained some valuable work experience as an auditor before transitioning to my current path. 
                    Now, I'm a second-year CSA student, exploring the world of tech with curiosity and dedication.
                    Beyond academics, I'm passionate about classical musicâ€”I play both the violin and the flute. In my free time, 
                    I enjoy staying active through volleyball and hiking.
