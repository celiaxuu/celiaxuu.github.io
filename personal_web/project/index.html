                <p>This project involves creating a basic version of the Pac-Man game using Processing in Python mode. 
                    It is divided into three main parts, focusing on fixing and enhancing specific aspects of the game. 
                    The goal is to bring Pac-Man to life by enabling his mouth movement (chomping), adding AI to Pinky (a ghost), 
                    and implementing dot-eating functionality to complete the game's core mechanics.

                <p>This project involves developing a Gomoku game (also known as Five in a Row), where a human player competes 
                    against an AI-controlled computer player on a 15x15 grid. The game includes several key features such as 
                    alternating turns between the human player and the AI, detecting five stones in a row, and saving player scores. 
                    Additionally, an AI algorithm helps the computer determine its moves, aiming to create a challenging experience 
                    for the player.

                <p>This project involves building a fully functional Unix shell, called K-SEA Shell (k-sesh), inspired by popular shells 
                    like Bash and Zsh. The shell serves as a command-line interface that interacts with the operating system, 
                    allowing users to execute commands, manage processes, and use built-in functionality. The K-SEA Shell can execute both built-in and external 
                    commands, manage processes, and provide an interactive game as a custom feature.</p>
