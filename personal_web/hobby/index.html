                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p>I have been playing the flute for over 15 years and the violin for over 8 years. 
                        Throughout this journey, I naturally became a fan of classical music. 
                        For me, what matters more than the performance itself is the patience and perseverance 
                        cultivated during the process of learning and practicing, as well as the comfort and inspiration 
                        that music provides me, no matter when or where.

                    <h2>Reading</h2>
                    <p>Reading always brings me calm and inspiration. My favorite book is "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Camus. 
                        Recently, I've developed a strong interest in Latin American literature.
                        However, traditional Chinese literature is the most important to me. 
                        I also enjoy participating in book clubs, as hearing others' different thoughts on the same work 
                        provides new perspectives and ideas.</p>

                    <h2>Photography</h2>
                    <p>I enjoy photography, especially taking portraits. 
                        During my undergraduate time, I took several photography classes and earned some extra money 
                        by photographing portraits for others. However, it's a bit awkward because my self-photography skills 
                        are really poorâ€”I feel uncomfortable in front of the camera, and my expressions and body movements 
                        become stiff. Recently, I've become very interested in using drones for videography.</p>

                    <h2>Volleyball</h2>
                    <p>Volleyball is a sport that I really enjoy, not just because it helps me relieve stress, but also because 
                        it offers a fantastic opportunity to connect with others. As a team sport, it fosters collaboration and 
                        camaraderie, making it a great way to meet new people and strengthen friendships. The shared experiences 
                        and mutual support on the court create a strong sense of community that goes beyond the game itself.
